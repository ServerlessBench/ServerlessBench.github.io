# Background

Serverless computing promises auto-scalability and cost-efficiency (pay-as-you-go manner) for high-productive software development.
It motivates new applications and services in the cloud and presents new challenges for the system software of the cloud. 
Facing the new computing model, both serverless platform designers and serverless users long to learn how to make better use of serverless computing.
